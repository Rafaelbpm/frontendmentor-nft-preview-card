## Overview

Working on this challenge was pretty fun! Although I thought it would be very similar to the “Preview Card,” my last challenge, the simple fact of having a hover state that adds another layer above the focused element made this challenge very challenging indeed.

I couldn’t figure out how to properly do the hover state on the nft-image, so I started to play around. I know that my solution is not how it should be, and that is pretty clear when you resize the project. Still, I decided to keep my solution because I was very proud that I could find a solution just by playing around with what I’ve learned so far.

I already took notes on the parts that I need to improve, and I’ll work on perfecting my gray areas in the projects that are to come!

Thanks for reading this :D
